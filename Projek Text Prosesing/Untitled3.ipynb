              "  'First, we have to stop calling these important people of the forest pygmies because it is a very disrespectful way to refer to someone as such. In the Ituri forest of Zaire are a small statured people called Bambuti which consist of two groups the Imbuti and the Efe. They are the earliest links to humankind and the first known human type as what we know today as homo sapiens that emerged in East Africa some 250 to 350 thousand years ago who later populated the rest of the world in places like India, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific as the aboriginal people of these locations. The 4.5-million-year-old fossil found in Ethiopia commonly known as Lucy (Dekenesh) was a small stature Hominid woman of the so- called pigmy type. This is not here say as it is buttressed, documented, verified and backed up by the anthropological and bimolecular scientific data. In addition, they are also located in Uganda called the Batwa and South Africa in the Kalahari called the San. This name &quot;Pigmy&quot; emerged during the early 19th century and perhaps earlier by British traveler John Barrow who travels Into the Interior of Southern Africa (1806). These groups of people have names and should be referred by their names or as small statured people in description but not some derogatory name to suit the Western mentality. It is obvious the narrator is reading from a script and has done no meaningful research of his own as he continues to be disrespectful by using the term pygmies. These groups thrive as hunter and gatherers who practice the purist form of what we know as communisms or shall I say egalitarianism. They have fought no wars, nor have they imposed themselves on any one or nations throughout their existence. They practice a system of sharing and caring that has sustained themselves for many thousands of years but have been interrupted and infringed on by Arab slavery, colonialism, and other neighboring countries (forced migration and industrialism) in the past several hundred years. These small statured people like the Bambuti (Mbuti &amp; Efe) were first observed by the Kemetians (Egyptians) during an exhibition to find the source of the Nile River in the fourth dynasty. In the tomb of Pharaoh Nefrikare is preserved (coffin text) a report from his commander Herkouf, who entered a great forest to the West of the Mountain of the Moon and discovered there a people of the trees a tiny people who sing and dance to their God, a dance such as had never been seen before. Nefrikare sent a reply ordering Herkouf to bring one of these dancers of God back with him, giving explicit instructions as to how he should be treated and cared for so that no harm would come to him. As a consequence, these small statured people such as the Baka and the Bambuti people of the forest were written in the annuals of Egyptian (Kemet) history as they became a part of Egyptian life and ultimately had important position in the society such as blacksmiths and jewelers. The Ankh is a symbol that represent eternal life and the tittle or name given to them was &quot;Ankhi&quot; The living one, as they rose to prominence.  We also have the ancient Egyptian deity Bes (so-called pigmy) who was worshipped as a protector of households and, in particular, of mothers, children, and childbirth. Bes later came to be regarded as the defender of everything good and the enemy of all that is bad. So, when we refer to these small stature people of the forest, we must refer to them by their group names and also as very important people to whom we owe respect and homage to.',\n",
