I’m reaching out because I believe Pakistan has so much to offer for your next documentary project, and I’d love to help make that happen.<br><br>Pakistan is a treasure trove of stories and stunning landscapes waiting to be captured. Imagine filming the Karakoram Range&#39;s towering peaks, the Hunza lush green valleys, and the bustling, colorful markets in our historic cities. I think you’d find so much diversity and beauty here fascinating.<br><br>Here’s how we can help you get the most out of your documentary adventure:<br><br>Easy Transportation: We’ve covered all your travel needs so you can focus on filming, not logistics.<br>Comfortable Stays: Whether you prefer cozy mountain lodges or chic city hotels, we’ll set you up with accommodations that suit your style.<br>Custom Itineraries: Have specific locations or themes in mind? We’ll tailor the trip to meet your exact needs.<br>Local Insights: Our experienced guides know the best spots and hidden gems, ensuring your documentary stands out<br>Cultural Connections: We’ll introduce you to local communities, allowing you to capture their traditions and everyday life up close.<br>Unique Stories: We provide unique stories and opportunities for YouTubers, Instagrammers, and TikTokers.<br>Shooting Anywhere: We have the license to shoot anywhere in Pakistan, allowing you to film without any worries.<br>Pakistan is still relatively under-explored in the documentary world, which means there are countless fresh and unique stories to tell. I would be thrilled to assist you in uncovering those stories.<br><br>If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, let’s chat! Reach out with questions or ideas you have. I’m excited about the possibility of working together and can’t wait to show you the wonders of Pakistan.<br><br>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon!<br><br>Warm regards,<br>Ali<br>Owner, Snowline Nature Tours<br>Contact Information+923360925969<br><br><a href=""http://snowlinenaturetours.com/"">snowlinenaturetours.com</a><br><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/snowline.nature.tours/?hl=en"">https://www.instagram.com/snowline.nature.tours/?hl=en</a><br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/snowlinenaturetour/"">https://www.facebook.com/snowlinenaturetour/</a><br>Snowline Nature Tours would love your feedback.

Worked all my life contributing to society just like everybody else. I&#39;ve held mostly supervisory positions as well. Never bragged to anybody about what i do. Most people i worked with in construction would always brag about how drunk they were gonna get that night while I&#39;d take a couple of puffs from a joint to mostly help me sleep. The next day you could definitely tell who drank the night before and who didn&#39;t. Alcohol over time completely wrecks your body while Marijuana seems to have very little effect.

2024-06-26T03:24:33Z,@RobertMBGH,"First, we have to stop calling these important people of the forest pygmies because it is a very disrespectful way to refer to someone as such. In the Ituri forest of Zaire are a small statured people called Bambuti which consist of two groups the Imbuti and the Efe. They are the earliest links to humankind and the first known human type as what we know today as homo sapiens that emerged in East Africa some 250 to 350 thousand years ago who later populated the rest of the world in places like India, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific as the aboriginal people of these locations. The 4.5-million-year-old fossil found in Ethiopia commonly known as Lucy (Dekenesh) was a small stature Hominid woman of the so- called pigmy type. This is not here say as it is buttressed, documented, verified and backed up by the anthropological and bimolecular scientific data. In addition, they are also located in Uganda called the Batwa and South Africa in the Kalahari called the San. This name &quot;Pigmy&quot; emerged during the early 19th century and perhaps earlier by British traveler John Barrow who travels Into the Interior of Southern Africa (1806). These groups of people have names and should be referred by their names or as small statured people in description but not some derogatory name to suit the Western mentality. It is obvious the narrator is reading from a script and has done no meaningful research of his own as he continues to be disrespectful by using the term pygmies. These groups thrive as hunter and gatherers who practice the purist form of what we know as communisms or shall I say egalitarianism. They have fought no wars, nor have they imposed themselves on any one or nations throughout their existence. They practice a system of sharing and caring that has sustained themselves for many thousands of years but have been interrupted and infringed on by Arab slavery, colonialism, and other neighboring countries (forced migration and industrialism) in the past several hundred years. These small statured people like the Bambuti (Mbuti &amp; Efe) were first observed by the Kemetians (Egyptians) during an exhibition to find the source of the Nile River in the fourth dynasty. In the tomb of Pharaoh Nefrikare is preserved (coffin text) a report from his commander Herkouf, who entered a great forest to the West of the Mountain of the Moon and discovered there a people of the trees a tiny people who sing and dance to their God, a dance such as had never been seen before. Nefrikare sent a reply ordering Herkouf to bring one of these dancers of God back with him, giving explicit instructions as to how he should be treated and cared for so that no harm would come to him. As a consequence, these small statured people such as the Baka and the Bambuti people of the forest were written in the annuals of Egyptian (Kemet) history as they became a part of Egyptian life and ultimately had important position in the society such as blacksmiths and jewelers. The Ankh is a symbol that represent eternal life and the tittle or name given to them was &quot;Ankhi&quot; The living one, as they rose to prominence.  We also have the ancient Egyptian deity Bes (so-called pigmy) who was worshipped as a protector of households and, in particular, of mothers, children, and childbirth. Bes later came to be regarded as the defender of everything good and the enemy of all that is bad. So, when we refer to these small stature people of the forest, we must refer to them by their group names and also as very important people to whom we owe respect and homage to.",0

This of course threatens their own Indigenous culture which is living at one with nature. But this is the desperate need when you are starving and unfortunately creates another dire situation of wild life extinction and trauma for babies sold as pets in the west  and stuck in dark cages and that&#39;s if they don&#39;t die of hunger, illness or mistreatment. They depend on their mum&#39;s for survival which they no longer have because she has been killed for her meat. And even if the babies are rescued and brought to a sanctuary it takes years to rehabilitate them and prepare them to be able to survive back in the wild.",0

2024-06-03T07:53:04Z,@Wodenseyes,"I spent 2 weeks deep in the Rainforest with a tribe of people that lived in it. They hunted and gathered stuff from the Forrest every day. They also grew tomatoes and peppers and some leafy plants that they’d grind up and mix with chili to eat in the morning. But about 80% of that village also grew their own weed. They would take bones from animals they’d killed and boiled all the flesh off before cooking them over the fire so they dry out before they crush them and mix urine and charcoal together as a fertilizer. The plants would get 9-12 feet tall and produced some of the most incredible marijuana there is on the planet. Orange, purple, red, yellow colors all over the buds. The smell was so strong when you’re 2 miles down wind you can still smell it. When they go to harvest hundreds of pounds they slash the plants down and hang them upside down to dry. Then sold it for (if I did the math right) 10lbs would get them about $260 American. These tribes get so ripped off by the other tribes and other African",2

By the looks of everyone&#39;s faces and their body language, they were very uncomfortable. The micro-expressions  and the body language of the main interviewer emitted guilt and shame. The indigenous people in the area have absolutely no reason to lie. They are extremely poverty stricken, yet they are far from stupid. Reminds me of how the Europeans entered into Africa in the 1500&#39;s, and my ancestors (from West Africa  and  the Congo) were so welcoming and hospitable to their peril. The Europeans were not there to trade; they were there to steal our resources, kidnap us and make us their slaves to build their wealth while they colonize our lands. Although this video is very educational and enlightening, it is somewhat disappointing  to see that some things never change.",0

2024-05-27T12:02:35Z,@battano,"People always say it&#39;s Africa being exploited that has impoverished so many there and kept African run nations underdeveloped and backwards. As a group you can see the same under developed behaviors from decedents in developed nations like the US and UK. That was at one time called tribalism and other things but now has been passed off as behaviors due to oppression and racism. <br><br>This video touches on the fact past generations considered some West Africans sub-human. Maybe they weren&#39;t wrong. <br><br>Now hear me out! Genetic research has proven Present-day sub-Saharan Africans trace up to 19% of their genetic ancestry to an extinct archaic hominid species (Homo erectus or Homo habilis) that is NOT found in the DNA of present-day non-Africans <br><br>In 2011 DNA from three groups (Biaka Pygmies, San, and Mandinka) were tested and shown to come from a now-extinct species that broke away from the modern human lineage over 700,000 years ago.<br><br>In 2012 another study tested three sub-Saharan African populations (Pygmies, Hadza, and Sandwe) and it was again found that the ancestors of modern African bred with different species of hominins, not found in the DNA of non-Africans<br><br>I think it&#39;s time the world acknowledge the difficult truths and that some problems can no longer be be blamed on exploitation, culture differences, or the oppression of past generations. I&#39;m all for leaving Africa to the Africans but just think what that would look like.....",0

I think of all the folks that would be clutching their pearls about teaching women to sell drugs instead of something else, but when kids get through school, even uni, and can’t find work back home, why not? It’s not the same as the drug dealers an American would think about…but being picked up off the street for sex is dangerous everywhere. Working the fields for veg to sell in the market is dangerous with rebel groups around, even. I am glad they’ve found a way to better their lives, connect to other women, and almost have a sort of support group where men and women smoke together and just…forget that life is hard for a bit. She’s a businesswoman, mentor, and therapist, at the very least. Respect to her - and all the women choosing ganja over prostitution in a difficult place!<br><br>Others like the Mbuti as well, who are making the best of an awful situation with weed, also get all my respect. Treated like subhumans, driven from their home, forced to change their way of life…but they can at least bring in a little money with weed, plus use it as natural medicine (and I appreciate their rule to only take leaves from their own plants or the medication doesn’t work, talk about good neighbors). We are all humans. We should be treated as humans. I hope, for the sake of them, the women in Goma, everyone really, that eastern Congo sees a lasting peace that doesn’t involve the west/China/Russia making a grab for resources in return for helping to rebuild and modernize infrastructure.<br><br>(oops I typed too much! but to your point, again, 1000% yes, she is an angel on earth for helping these struggling women avoid prostitution.)",45

This guys ok but man hes no strain hunters. Man i miss them so sad he passed away. This guy doesent get to see the best crops and the real real of the countries he goes to because he doesent have the multiple decades long relationships with all the cannabis and hashish farmers around the world even before countries started to legalize decrminalize and allow medicinal use so hes being shown the small pretty low quality or young plants not anywhere close to the top notch farms and growers. franco had those relationships and was getting insanely good gentics in areas that no foriegner has ever been allowed to go before getting true landrace strains untouched by time with completely unique terpenes and canabanoids which is why to this day if you want some landrace strains the only true real quality seeds avaliable are from them.,0

I was making  general point of advice, not about you specifically. But, I&#39;m very happy to discuss your specific situation.<br>Full disclosure and with some regrets, I have little more than a 55 year old high school education and have a degree in the hard knocks of life.<br>Since you&#39;re making this about your own personal life. Who are you?<br>1: A teenager preparing for the 9th grade <br>2: A school dropout, which never looks good on job applications, while competing against college grads. From most employers&#39; POV, that indicates being a rebel, undisciplined, a know-it all attitude, lack of initiative, ... That doesn&#39;t even address the applicant&#39;s appearance at the interview, where one is judged the harshest. <br>3: Perhaps you&#39;re an adult, married with children, working 2 minimum wage jobs to support yourselves? Splitting the rent in a shared apartment? Been there, done with that. Just made my final mortgage payment on my home, 100% free of debt and finally able to live the free life @ 72.

It is your own life to gamble with those odds. But, it is irresponsible to advocate that others will be happy and prosperous with only an 8th grade education.<br>The point of my comment is that we live, work, and socialize (or not)  within a rapidly changing competitive global economy, which requires higher education in science, math, physics, software engineering, A. I., EVs, CAD/CAM, medicine, genetic engineering,..<br>Those are the same skills that have made Bezos, Musk, Gates, and many others billionaires (while exploiting the undereducated).<br>Think about it. I&#39;d love to hear your deeper thoughts for achieving your own version of success, which constantly changes with life, conditions, and maturity.

2024-05-30T00:35:47Z,@RosscoAW,"African leaders aren&#39;t responsible, Western society is. It is Western corporations responsible for establishing and maintaining the international order -- hell, in most cases the literal borders and nation-states themselves arise from European colonialism and imperialism -- and it is Western corporations and the international capitalist class that benefits from these conditions. Warlords and leaders and politicians and companies in African nations are just the middle-men, fighting for territory that they can then sell out to Western corporations and their intermediaries, so white people in Europe and North America can have limitless, cheap treats and we can subsidize our fat asses sitting on couches watching TV and doom scrolling social media platforms all day, all in the service of feeding our own scant (albeit Western) salaries into products and services that benefit Western shareholders.<br><br>Capitalism is at fault, not &quot;african leaders.&quot; African leaders aren&#39;t even capable of ending the situation if they wanted to, only America and to a lesser extent the EU at large  -- and, eventually/increasingly, China -- have any power to affect the state of economic barbarism that prevails in much of sub-saharan Africa. It is a state of national duress and economic dysfunction that inhibits development and benefits Western shareholders through the provision of massive quantities of natural resources at incredibly cheap rates, and in such a manner that doesn&#39;t require Western corporations to actually invest in African countries in a way that would benefit local populations, by guaranteeing appropriate wages, access to labour, or even the existence of real companies instead of just leaving areas to be plundered by warlords and criminal organizations so you can secure backroom deals with said illicit, greymarket and blackmarket enterprises for your own capitalist benefit.<br><br>If you want to blame leaders for this situation, blame the white ones leading predominantly white nation-states, they&#39;re the only leaders responsible: and even then, they&#39;re just intermediaries for the global ruling class -- the capitalists -- actually responsible. Neoliberal capitalism as heralded by American Empire is at fault, and only American Empire currently dominates the world in such a way that would enable resolving these issues: America, of course, does not want these issues resolved, America wants its large, publicly-traded corporations to continue to have access to massive quantities of extremely cheap natural resources. The only competition to America is China, and China is just playing the exact same game as America, just better (more long-term); however, China, at least, seems at least slightly interested in actually investing in other nations domestically, through their BRI and other initiatives, something America has just complained about for the past decade instead of actually putting money where their mouth is (like China). <br><br>It&#39;s, clearly, white greed and selfishness that are at fault here, given the world currently operates according to America&#39;s system of white supremacist jingoism.",0

Practically infeasible… <br><br>But this same concept that their Ancestor used to keep people honest &amp; in checc to stop or keep stealing to minimal levels is the same thing the Colonizer Europeans did with all the lands they conquered; They made a god for that land &amp; told the people follow the rules we make or God will punish you … &amp; then in certain places (i.e. North America) the populace was so uncontrollable &amp; rebellious that the ruling class decided to make an even “Scarier” “Being or Deity” that would represent everything evil called the Devil &amp; they made a imaginary land called Hell to increase the amount of fear in the population as much as possible to allow the ruling class to gain a stronghold to control everyone. They claimed all who don’t follow our rules will die &amp; their souls will be sent to this place to burn in pain &amp; agony for eternity… But how did the devil just magically appear &amp; get added to the Bible after being nonexistent for all that time, God, Jesus, &amp; Devil-Less Bibles had already been around for decades 🤔 … Also, how does a Ethereal Body(Soul) “Burn” &amp; feel pain ? When pain is specifically something only in the physical , where your body has pain receptors &amp; nerves that send electrical signals to your brain &amp; your brain sends one back to the receptors to tell you to feel pain. No Body, No Brain, No Pain Receptors, No Nerves, No Electrical Signals Running Through The Nerves, Receptors, &amp; Brain = NO PAIN 😂😂😂",0

At 24mins in Muteba’s wife Elize speaks the truth, she is the person who makes the family finance complete. She is likely to fund their children to be able to go to University. He is an example of how things were when we were sold into slavery. At 27mins in the UN man fails to mention how the UN presence enables corrupt government officials to sell off the land to countries such as China and Canada who mine and export the countries natural mineral resources. A few years ago I visited Kinshasa in the Democratic republic of Congo – DRC while there I saw so so many UN vehicles around seemingly doing noting noteworthy allowing so called legal mining. One day we took a trip out as I wanted to visit the national park an area I was told was like the ‘Garden of Eden. On our way we went to the village of a friend and past a small settlement of so called Pigmy people.  We crossed a huge road as wide as a six lane wide motorway was being cut out of the red earth, as far as the eye could see, trees and plants devastated - the sight was unbelievable. It was being dug out by ginormous digging machines to allow plant and processing machinery to be able to mine and export the mineral resources on a vast scale. The image at 37mins in is real and sadly can be seen in many African countries. So called legal mining of natural resources such as gold, cobalt, copper, precious stones etc. being mined and exported on a mass scale while the citizens of the country do not benefit at all from so much corruption. 30mins the interview goes left.

From barrel of oil, new Russia were getting just $1. It was a money making source, but Putin did change it and Russia is not perfect right now, but comparing 90&#39;s and our days in Russia, it is like comparing day and night. Same things are not just in Congo, but in Africa whole. Western companies are putting corrupt leaders who are working for them and the more violence they create, more money they get. Muamar Gadaffi tryed to unite Africa, he was weird guy sometimes, but Lybia were stable and with high living standarts. And now, where is that stability???Western way of life needs Africa to be poor, to fight each other, to get what they need without pay. And its sad! all the best to good people of Congo!!!Bless!!",0

The creator put everything on earth for us insects animals and humans to use, the US thinks it owns the planet sorry US you own your stoles states and no more. The world is for all people and the First people on earth were in AFRICA THEY KNOW KOST PLANTS AND THERE USES EXPORTED THEM TO OTHER LANDS THEY traveled to in ancient times. It most likely has lots of good uses we humans don’t know these days I do know it’s a great healer of many ailments if used as tea eaten or smoked, though all this must be in moderation as we would a doctors pill, those pills have so much man made chemicals in them the majority have terrible side affects though claimed to heal,  what pill heals what most people are on pills for life, it’s a big Pharma ploy to make ,only. If Hungary was used and science has found many ways it can be we would have less ill people on opioids and other addictive meds. It can be treated to prevent mental stress and could assist in psychotic mental issues if used properly. They don’t want us to use that as it’s so easily grown we could all grow our own they want us to take what they make and we cannot. It’s so wrong. The same with the rain forest it olds many plant s that could be beneficial for us all, instead they cut,it down destroying the economy system of the AFRICAN CONTINENT AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE  WORLD.  Animals know how to treat themselves and some scientists study CHIMPANZEES OUR NEAREST RELATIVES AS DNA PROVES. They use certain -lands to heal wounds and help with digestion all plants need to be scientifically examined and one day we could find that humans do not get ill as much or perhaps not at all. The flu and cold still haven’t got a cure. There must be a substance out in the wide world that can cure them. It would save millions upon millions of lives. Asthma bronchial disease can be helped by Gunga. Though the way we live in polluted towns cities etc the pollutants overtake the major benefits of the gunga effects. Epilepsy has been known t o be stabilised by the cannabinoids is a start.  a start. Though not available on prescription ion in most countries =.

As Chinese have accounts of arriving to Japan to find a people about half their size. But this does not describe the height of Ainu, nor the difference in height of Chinese compared to Japanese. In fact virtually every Culture on earth has oral history about legendary little people. I have dutch genes so Im like a giant. This height adaptation was probably made possible around bell beaker 2800BC, as milk, grain and livestock farming became more popular to allow the resourced needed to get huge. Thus stressing local indigenous populations with much taller and technologically advanced competition, But if you look around theres some people of much smaller heights in our modern populations, which suggests their genes are there and admixed into us.",0

I recommend you find a good small batch grower who actually cares about his product. Been smoking for weed for 26 years abs never has it been so bad. Most of what is on the streets is dispensary bud as well. Boof. Couldn’t ever really expect much from a corporate commercial crop anyways. I’m just surprised that there are some people who actually get high off the crap. Says a lot about the quality of weed that was available to you before legalization. It must have been  extremely bad weed. That wasn’t the case for me or anyone I know. Smoked a lot  top dollar dispensary weed in 4 states and none of it was better than mids. Potency similar to Mexican brick weed but it looked better. Smelled better. That was it,9

They chop when the bud looks done but not when it’s actually mature. Beyond that, it’s like everything else that government and big corporations touch. It turns to crap. We see what they do to our food and everything we ingest. Basically poisoned all out lives. No different with the weed game and it’s amazing to me that people can be so naive. Sudden they trust purely profit driven big corporations. Dirty contaminated product does hit the shelves. Mold is a serious issue. Plant growth regulators are a serious issue in the community as well. Ever noticed how they often sell buds that are like small rocks now? Never seen bud in my life that was like that except for heavily compressed Mexican brick weed. Pgr bud is impotent trash. It’s all about the weight.",0
